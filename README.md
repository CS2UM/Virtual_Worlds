# Virtual Worlds and Synthetic Data: examples from EVE Online
Online virtual worlds are both promising venues for large scale social science research, and an increasingly important complement to life in the “real” world.  I will discuss some of my ongoing research with the MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) EVE Online.  EVE presents to players a relatively unstructured virtual universe in which they must decide how to forge an identity, earn money, and relate to other players.  For the purposes of this talk I will focus on the relationship between character attributes and aggressive game play.  The talk will have three components.  First, the tools used, in an R/SQL environment, for manipulating and analyzing trillions of data points from over 7 million discrete players.  Second, guidelines for understanding the data generating processes in the game and for drawing valid inferences from analysis.  Third, a discussion of simulation tools that allow researchers to share synthetic datasets without revealing private information.
